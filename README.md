# Todoist

A simple Task lister built in the process of understanding Django and POSTGRES.

### Features:
* User can add a task
* Checkbox deletion with confirmation.
* Confirmation of deleting the task permanently.

Though the project  follwed online resources mostly. It helps me to learn the process of integrating the POSTGRES to Django and actual things happening behind every step (e.g: Django ORM services, migrations to database) and order of connecting urls,views and fontent html page.
